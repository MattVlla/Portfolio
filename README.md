Matthew Villa's Portfolio

  This is my Portfolio I created using html, css and a little bit of js. This webpage was created by using sections in the body to add classes and id's to the unordered list. Doing this allowed me to anchor the unordered list so that when clicked on it will scroll you to the appropriate scetions. I used divs to single out or group up certain parts for it to be easier to isolate or group up into certain actions I wanted performed. I also added an About me button that works when you click on it takes you to that section. Also added were links to my email, github, and linkedln which I styled using icons. Using js I was able to add a hamburger button to where the webpage responds for screens smaller than 1000px. In doing so the webpage shrinks and the projects section stacks on top of eachother, and on a smaller screen the hamburger button is useful for when clicked shows the unordered list. 

This is what it looks like,
